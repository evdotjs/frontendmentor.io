      <p class="body-m">
        A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.' Maintaining a healthy weight may lower your chances of experiencing health issues later
        on, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim for a nutritious diet with reduced fat and sugar content, incorporating ample fruits and vegetables.
        Additionally, strive for regular physical activity, ideally about 30 minutes daily for five days a week.

      <h2 class="heading-l">Limitations of BMI</h2>
      <p class="body-m">
        Although BMI is often a practical indicator of healthy weight, it is not suited for every person. Specific groups should carefully consider their BMI
        outcomes, and in certain cases, the measurement may not be beneficial to use.
      </p>

      <div class="limitation_card">
        <h4 class="heading-s">Gender</h4>
        <p class="body-m">
          The development and body fat composition of girls and boys vary with age. Consequently, a child's age and gender are considered when evaluating their
          BMI.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="limitation_card">
        <h4 class="heading-s">Age</h4>
        <p class="body-m">In aging individuals, increased body fat and muscle loss may cause BMI to underestimate body fat content.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="limitation_card">
        <h4 class="heading-s">Muscle</h4>
        <p class="body-m">BMI may misclassify muscular individuals as overweight or obese, as it doesn't differentiate muscle from fat.</p>

        <h4 class="heading-s">Pregnancy</h4>
        <p class="body-m">
          Expectant mothers experience weight gain due to their growing baby. Maintaining a healthy pre-pregnancy BMI is advisable to minimise health risks for
          both mother and child.

        <h4 class="heading-s">Race</h4>
        <p class="body-m">
          Certain health concerns may affect individuals of some Black and Asian origins at lower BMIs than others. To learn more, it is advised to discuss this
          with your GP or practice nurse.
