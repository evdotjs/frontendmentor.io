## My process

- My plan is to complete this challenge twice: first, using vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript and second, using React/SASS.
- I started off by analyzing the design file in figma, seeing how the information was organized, then marking up the information using semantic HTML tags.
- After that I decided work on the CSS one section at a time, starting with the hero section.
- Next in javascript I added the ability to toggle between imperial and metric units in the HTML form.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
